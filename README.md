Iâ€™ve created this insightful Finance Power BI dashboard.

In this project, I explored various aspects of Power BI, including:

1. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): I honed my skills in writing DAX formulas to manipulate data and create custom measures.
2. Data Visualization: I crafted visually compelling charts and graphs to effectively communicate data insights.
3. Bookmarks: I leveraged bookmarks to create interactive reports and enhance user experience.
4. Interactive Tooltip Visuals: I added interactive tooltips to provide additional context and insights to users.
5. Dynamic Title Change for Visuals Using DAX: I utilized DAX to dynamically change the titles of visuals, making the report more interactive.
